# RYLR998

The RYLR998, developed by REYAX Technology, is a compact LoRa® transceiver module designed for ultra-long-range communication, high interference resistance, and low power consumption. Operating in the 868/915 MHz frequency range, it integrates a NUVOTON MCU and Semtech LoRa® engine, supports UART with AT commands, and achieves transmission distances of up to 20 km in ideal conditions—all within a small 32×14×2.2 mm form factor suitable for space-limited applications.
Compared to traditional wireless methods like FSK or GFSK, the RYLR998 offers higher sensitivity (down to -129 dBm) and extended battery life, making it ideal for IoT devices that rely on efficient energy use. Despite its slightly higher cost, its superior range, reliability, and efficiency make it a cost-effective alternative for markets such as smart homes, agriculture, vehicles, mobile devices, and energy monitoring, helping enterprises build IoT solutions more effectively.
